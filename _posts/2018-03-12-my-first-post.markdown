Hello there strangers, I have some time so I wanted to try this jekyll sourcery.

My first impression about this is that this won't fit my requirementes, this is so focused to blogs and not to static pages, those with some lazy personal info and boring projects that people doesn't like at all. Maybe I find a way to create that personal website or perhaps I start blogging.

I will make some experiments at my igloo lab (I see penguins everywhere) and then come back here soon. Till then, I leave you with a good friend.
